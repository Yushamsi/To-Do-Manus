## Deployment Details

### Backend Deployment

The Flask backend has been deployed as a web service with the following modifications:

1. Added `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies:
   - Flask
   - Flask-CORS
   - Gunicorn (WSGI server)

2. Updated `app.py` to use environment variables for port configuration

3. Created a `Procfile` for web server configuration

4. Deployed using Gunicorn as the production web server

### Frontend Deployment

The Nuxt.js frontend has been deployed as a static website with the following modifications:

1. Updated the API base URL in `nuxt.config.ts` to point to the deployed backend
2. Added PostCSS as a dependency for Tailwind CSS in production
3. Generated a static build using `npm run generate`
4. Deployed the static files to a permanent hosting service

## Application Features

The deployed application includes all the features of the original to-do list application:

- View all to-do items
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Testing Results

All functionality has been tested and works correctly in the deployed environment:

- ✅ Adding new tasks
- ✅ Marking tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Deleting tasks
- ✅ Responsive design on different screen sizes

## Maintenance Notes

- The backend is currently using in-memory storage, which means data will be reset if the server restarts
- For a production environment, consider implementing a database for persistent storage
- The frontend is deployed as a static site, which provides excellent performance and reliability
